# About Contact Book

This contact book application uses the Trie (or Prefix Tree) data structure to arrange contact names in an alphabetical order and allows the user to search for specific individuals depending on the prefix they entered in the search field. The core functionality of this app (add, remove, and search) has also been tested using **unittest** module. Furthermore, this app comes with a graphical user interface built with Tkinter for ease of use.

# To-Do

Currently the application is very basic with only the actual contact book Tkinter frame implemented. As of right now, the login and register frame do not have any functionality for their intended purpose.

Future plans for this project includes:
- Keep working on the design of the UI, and fix up any UI specific issues.
- Implement database functionality with MongoDB 
  - Allow user to log in with contacts they've added, as well as add/remove contacts
  - User can register an account in order to have their own list of contacts information.
- Figure out a way to have contacts with same name, but have different information such as phone number.
